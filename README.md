# Platform Reference for [r/TranscribersOfReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index)
An *unofficial* repository of references (and sometimes unofficial templates) for various platforms that r/TranscribersOfReddit users may come across. (Partly inspired by u/Halailah and [ToR-Repost-Collection](https://github.com/codingJWilliams/ToR-Repost-Collection)).

The example screenshots are either created by me or taken from Reddit.

Keep in mind, when in doubt, ask the mods (or other transcribers).

## Pull requests are very much appreciated

In the case that you don't know how, you may ask me in the ToR Discord (either to have me just add it or to learn how to create a PR).
