# Platform Reference for [r/TranscribersOfReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index)
An *unofficial* repository of references (and sometimes unofficial templates) for various platforms that r/TranscribersOfReddit users may come across. (Partly inspired by u/Halailah and [ToR-Repost-Collection](https://github.com/codingJWilliams/ToR-Repost-Collection)).

The example screenshots are either created by me, taken from Reddit, or from various other image websites.

Keep in mind, when in doubt, ask the mods (or other transcribers). Also keep in mind that when copying an unofficial template in the repo, copy the raw text (click the `Raw` button in the file) or the formatting won't appear in reddit.

## Pull requests are very much appreciated

In the case that you don't know how, you may ask me in the ToR Discord (either to have me just add it or to learn how to create a PR).
